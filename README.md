#### A simple python script to interact with the gcloud commandline tool. The features are

2. stop - Stop the instance
3. ssh - ssh into the instance.
4. add - Add a new instance details

All the config details of the instances are stored in the config file (default location $HOME/.kcloudconfig. The config contains details like Project, Zone etc...)
